    <h2>Overview</h2>
	  <p>
	  Welcome to flightaware.github.com, the home of a number of
	  open source projects originated or adopted by FlightAware
	  over the last few years.
	  </p>
    <h2>dump1090</h2>
	<p>
	<b><a href="dump1090">dump1090</a></b> is a
	program that can decode ADS-B and Mode S data broadcasts from
	aircraft when using an RTL-SDR software-defined radio dongle
	and a computer such as a Raspberry Pi.
	  </p>
    <h2>piaware</h2>
	<p>
	<b><a href="piaware">piaware</a></b> is a package intended
	to forward data read from an ADS-B receiver to FlightAware.
	It is fully open source and also supports multilateration
	so in many cases it can figure out the positions of aircraft
	not equipped with modern ADS-B transponders.
	  </p>
    <h2>casstcl</h2>
	<p>
	<b><a href="casstcl">casstcl</a></b> is a Tcl language
	interface to the Cassandra database system.  It is completely
	asynchronous, thread safe, supports prepared statements, batches,
	and all types of Cassandra collections.  It is compatible with
	Cassandra binary protocol version 1 and 2, supports encryption
	via SASL and SSL, and manages all the data type conversions behind your back.
	  </p>

    <h2>kafkatcl</h2>
	<p>
	<b><a href="kafkatcl">kafkatcl</a></b> is a Tcl language
	interface to the Apache Kafka distributed messaging system.
	It provides a natural Tcl interface, is fast, asynchronous,
	thread safe, and free.
	  </p>

    <h2>speedtables</h2>
	<p>
	<b><a href="speedtables">speedtables</a></b> is a
	high-performance memory-resident database. The speed table
	compiler reads a table definition and generates a set of C
	access routines to create, manipulate and search tables
	containing millions of rows. Currently oriented towards Tcl.
	  </p>

    <h2>scotty</h2>
	<p>
	<b><a href="scotty">scotty</a></b> is a Tcl extension for
	network management that provides support for sending and
	receiving ICMP packets, querying the Domain Name sSystem,
	accessing UDP sockets from Tcl, sending and receiving
	SNMP messsages, and more.
	</p>
	Originally written by Juergen Schoenwaelder, along with many
	contributors, FlightAware, along with contributors, has
	modernized and continued to update and maintain this useful tool.
	  </p>

    <h2>tcl-jira-api</h2>
	<p>
	<b><a href="tcl-jira-api">tcl-jira-api</a></b> provides a
	native Tcl interface to the JIRA REST API.  It supports
	logging into Jira and then getting issues, issue types, roles,
	transitions, etc, and can by used to programatically create
	issues, add comments, etc.
	  </p>

    <h2>mdsplib</h2>
	<p>
	<b><a href="mdsplib">mdsplib</a></b> is a parser for
	METARs, aviation weather data reports that contain data
	about temperature, wind speed and direction, cloud cover
	and heights, visibility, precipitation, barometric pressure,
	etc.
	  </p>
	Originally written and released by the United States National
	Weather Service, this version contains many bug fixes and has
	been updated to work with modern C compilers.
	  </p>

    <h2>tcl.gd</h2>
	<p>
	<b><a href="tcl.gd">tcl.gd</a></b> is a new Tcl interface to the 
	<a href="http://libgd.org/">GD drawing library</a>
	that is nearly 100% feature complete with GD and provides
	Tcl developers with the ability to read and write JPEG, PNG, GIF,
	WBMP, animated GIF, and other formats and manipulate indexed color
	and truecolor images by drawing pixels, lines, polygons, rectangles,
	arcs, ellipses, etc, doing fills, drawing text with truetype fonts,
	draw anti-aliased, resize, resample, rotate and merge images, etc.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  It's complete, solid, and fast.
	  </p>
    <h2>yajl-tcl</h2>
	<p>
	<b><a href="yajl-tcl">yajl-tcl</a></b> is a Tcl C extensions written
	to make the <a href="http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/">
	Yet Another JSON Library (YAJL)</a> JSON parsing and generating
	C library available to Tcl programs.
	</p>
	<p>
	Although there is already a package in the tcllib library, 
	<a href="http://tcllib.sourceforge.net/doc/huddle.html">huddle</a>,
	that can generate JSON, the big advantage in using yajl-tcl is performance.
	Also, yajl-tcl can parse JSON as well as generating it.
	</p>
	<p>
	In a benchmark generating JSON representing 5,000 airports with code,
	name, latitude and longitude, yajl-tcl was 157 times faster than huddle.
	</p>

    <h2>tclbsd</h2>
	<p>
	<b><a href="tclbsd">tclbsd</a></b> is a Tcl C extensions written
          to provide Tcl bindings
          to various BSD UNIX system calls and library routines.
          </p>
          <p>
          tclbsd provides interfaces to get the system load average
          (getloadavg), get and set hard and soft resource limits (rlimit),
          obtain the resource usage for the current process or its children
          (rusage), set the process title (setproctitle), get information
          about mounted filesystems (statfs and getfsstat), log to the
          system log (syslog), abort the process (abort), and obtain system
          clock counts (cptime).
	</p>
    <h2>tcllauncher</h2>
    <p>
    <b><a href="tcllauncher">tcllauncher</a></b> is a way to have Tcl applications run 
    under their own name, be installed in one place with all
    their support files, and provides them with commands to facilitate server-oriented 
    application execution.
    </p>
    <h2>More to Come</h2>
    <p>
	the rest of the projects can be found at <a href="https://github.com/flightaware">https://github.com/flightaware</a>.  They are being ongoingly improved.
	You can find repositories for a high-performance memory-resident database
	(speedtables), splining from Tcl without Tk (tclspline), 
	and others.
